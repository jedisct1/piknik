* Version 0.7
 - The number of simultaneous connections to a Piknik server can now
be controlled with the `-maxclients` command-line flag. When more than
90% of the available slots are filled, new sessions can only be open by
client IPs having recently completed a successful handshake.
 - New command-line flags: `-timeout` and `-datatimeout` in order to
enforce deadlines for handshakes and data transfers.

* Version 0.6
 - Improved error messages

* Version 0.5
 - A new switch, `-password` can now follow `-genkeys` in order to
deterministically derive the keys from a password. Not recommended,
but it can be useful to create an temporary initial configuration on air
gapped devices.
 - An Homebrew (tap) formula was added to easily install it and keep it up
to date on MacOS.

* Version 0.4
 - Servers recomputed the key ID instead of reading it from the
client, requiring the `EncryptSk` property to be present. This is no
longer the case. Thanks to jpmens@ for the bug report.

* Version 0.3
 - Improved documentation
 - The protocol was slightly changed; old clients are still supported
but the server must be updated in order to communicate with clients
running this version.
 - Precompiled binaries are now available for many architectures.

* Version 0.2
 - New `-move` operation to paste the clipboard content and delete it
afterwards. This introduces a protocol change, requiring an update to
the server and to the clients.

* Version 0.1
 - Initial public release.
